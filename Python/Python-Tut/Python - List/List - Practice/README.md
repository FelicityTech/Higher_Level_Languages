# Python Lists

## Create a Python list:
** Use of operator and concatenation

## List Indices
If an index has a positive value it counts from the beginning and similarly it count backward if the index has a negative value.
 As positive integers are used to index from the left end and negative integers are used to index from the right end, so every item of a list gives two alternative indices.
color_list=["Red", "Blue", "Green", "Black"]
index(from left): 0 = Red, 1 = Blue, 2 = Green, 3 = Black
index(from right) -4 = Red, -3 = Blue, -2 = Green , -1 = Black
given any index will produce error message from interpreter.
if you give any index value which is out of range then interpreter creates error message.

### Add an item to the end of the list

### Insert an item at a given position: list.insert(position, value)

###  Modify an element by Using the index of the element
### Remove an item from the list: list.remove(x) x is item to remove

### Remove all items from the list


## List Slices

** Lists can sliced like strings and other sequences.
### Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it

## List Methods

### Return the index in the list of the first item whose value is x
### Reverse the elements of the list in place

### Return the number of times 'x' appear in the list
### Sort the items of the list in place: list.sort( key=None, reverse=False)[alphabetically ascending]
### Reverse the elements of the list in place
### Return a shallow copy of the list
### Search the Lists and find Element
## Lists are Mutable

# Lists are Mutable
Items in the list are mutable i.e. after creating a list you can change any item in the list. See the following statements.
# Convert a list to a tuple in Python

## Find the largest and the smallest item in a list

## Compare two lists in Python

## Using Lists as Stacks
